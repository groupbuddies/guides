Ruby Style Guide
=====

[Sample](samples/ruby.rb)

* Avoid conditional modifiers (lines that end with conditionals).
* Avoid multiple assignments per line (`one, two = 1, 2`).
* Avoid organizational comments (`# Validations`).
* Avoid ternary operators (`boolean ? true : false`). Use multi-line `if`
  instead to emphasize code branches.
* Avoid explicit return statements.
* Avoid using semicolons.
* Avoid assignments on conditionals.
* Prefer `detect` over `find`.
* Prefer `inject` over `reduce`.
* Prefer `map` over `collect`.
* Prefer `select` over `find_all`.
* Prefer single quotes for strings.
* Use `do...end` for multi line blocks and `{...}` for one line blocks.
* Use `_` for unused block parameters.
* Use `%{}` for single-line strings needing interpolation and double-quotes.
* Use `&&` and `||` for Boolean expressions.
* Use `?` suffix for predicate methods.
* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules, `snake_case` for variables and
  methods, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
* Use `def self.method`, not `def Class.method` or `class << self`.
* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments.
* Use `each`, not `for`, for iteration.
* Use heredocs for multi-line strings.
* Use `%w()` and `%i()` for hard-coded lists of strings and symbols.

Rails
-----

* Avoid `member` and `collection` routes.
* Use private instead of protected when defining controller methods.
* Name date columns with `_on` suffixes.
* Name datetime columns with `_at` suffixes.
* Name initializers for their gem name.
* Order ActiveRecord associations alphabetically by attribute name.
* Order ActiveRecord validations alphabetically by attribute name.
* Order controller contents: filters, public methods, private methods.
* Order model contents: constants, macros, public methods, private methods.
* Put application-wide partials in the [`app/views/application`] directory.
* Use `def self.method`, not the `scope :method` DSL.
* Use the default `render 'partial'` syntax over `render partial: 'partial'`.

Rails Routes
------------

* Avoid the `:except` option in routes.
* Order resourceful routes alphabetically by name.
* Use the `:only` option to explicitly state exposed routes.
* When specifying `:only`, order the routes following the resource's lifecycle:
  `index`, `new`, `create`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`.
  ```ruby
  # Good
  resources :posts, only: %i(index new create show destroy)

  # Bad
  resources :posts, only: %i(index show destroy create new)
  ```

Background Jobs
---------------

* Define a `PRIORITY` constant at the top of delayed job classes.
* Define two public methods: `self.enqueue` and `perform`.
* Put delayed job classes in `app/jobs`.

Email
-----

* Use one `ActionMailer` for the app. Name it `Mailer`.
* Use the user's name in the `From` header and email in the `Reply-To` when
  [delivering email on behalf of the app's users].

Testing
---

[Sample](samples/testing.rb)

* Follow the [best practices](/best-practices#testing)
* Prefer factories to fixtures.
* Avoid the `private` keyword in specs.
* Prefer `eq` to `==` in RSpec.
* Separate setup, exercise, verification, and teardown phases with newlines.
* Use RSpec's [`expect` syntax](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2012/06/rspecs-new-expectation-syntax).
* Use `not_to` instead of `to_not` in RSpec expectations.
* Use an `it` example for each execution path through the method.
* Use shared contexts but include them explicitly with `include_context`

#### Acceptance Tests

* Avoid scenario titles that add no information, such as "successfully."
* Avoid scenario titles that repeat the feature title.
* Place helper methods for feature specs directly in a top-level `Features`
  module.
* Use Capybara's `feature/scenario` DSL.
* Use names like `ROLE_ACTION_spec.rb`, such as
  `user_changes_password_spec.rb`, for feature spec file names.
* Use only one `feature` block per feature spec file.
* Use scenario titles that describe the success and failure paths.
* Use spec/features directory to store feature specs.
* Use spec/support/features for support code related to feature specs.

#### Factories

* Order `factories.rb` contents: sequences, traits, factory definitions.
* Order factory attributes: implicit attributes, explicit attributes,
  child factory definitions. Each section's attributes are alphabetical.
* Order factory definitions alphabetically by factory name.
* Use one factories.rb file per project.

#### Unit Tests

[Sample](samples/testing.rb)

* Don't prefix `it` block descriptions with 'should'.
* Use `context` blocks for each method under test and name them accordingly. Use `.method`
  for class methods and `#method` for instance methods.
